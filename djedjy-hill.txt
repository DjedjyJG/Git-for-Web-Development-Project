    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    - In order to master real life experiences in which each team apply their own strategies for submitting projects or keeping them organized, Lambda teaches Forking and Branching. Forking is the equivalent of copying the project into your very own version so that you can edit, change, and do whatever that you need to do with it without changing the original project itself. Branching is used so that you modify the project on your own branch which has your first name (dash) your last name on it and not working on the master branch. 
    - For ex: With a new project, you first fork it, you add your TL as collaborator, you clone the project, then you branch the project, you then push the project to origin, at this point you'll be able to compare your fork with the master branch and you 'll be able to add your TL as a reviewer so that you can request a pull into the main master branch.
